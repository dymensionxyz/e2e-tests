### Test Handling Table

| Scenario | Pre-condition | Pre-condition check | Expected result | Expected result check |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| IBC transfer from rollapp to hub succeeds when rollapp has NO FINALIZED STATES AT ALL | At least 2 rollapps running, Rollapp A and B. Rollapp B (our rollapp) has no finalized state. Rollapp B has height > Rollapp A height. Rollapp B has a channel-id different from the hub-channel-id. | Check initial conditions for rollapps, ensure no finalized state for Rollapp B. | Rollapp tokens successfully transferred to hub despite no finalized states. | Verify tokens received at hub, no remaining commitments on Rollapp B. |
| Rollapp token transfer should only be received on the hub upon rollapp finalized state | At least 2 rollapps running, Rollapp A and B. Rollapp B (our rollapp) is at finalized height < Rollapp A finalized height. Rollapp B has a channel-id different from the hub-channel-id. | Ensure Rollapp B is below finalized height of Rollapp A and check channel IDs. | Rollapp tokens received on hub only after Rollapp B reaches finalized state. | Confirm receipt of tokens on hub and verify state finalization of Rollapp B. |
| Rollapp token Demand order is created upon memo submission and fulfilled | User interacts with UI; At least 2 rollapps running, Rollapp A and B. Rollapp B is at finalized height < Rollapp A finalized height. Rollapp B has a channel-id different from the hub-channel-id. | Check user interface for input capabilities, validate initial rollapp states. | Demand order for Rollapp tokens created and fulfilled upon memo submission. | Validate creation and fulfillment of demand order, check transaction records. |
| EIBC Timeout from hub to rollapp | User interaction via CLI; At least 2 rollapps running, Rollapp A and B. Rollapp B (our rollapp) is at finalized height < Rollapp A finalized height. Rollapp B has a channel-id different from the hub-channel-id. | Confirm settings and state via CLI, check Rollapp Bâ€™s height relative to A. | Timeout triggered for EIBC transaction from hub to rollapp due to non-finalization. | Verify timeout execution and rollback of tokens or state as configured. |
| EIBC + PFM | User interaction via CLI; At least 2 rollapps running, Rollapp A and B. Rollapp B (our rollapp) is at finalized height < Rollapp A finalized height. Rollapp B has a channel-id different from the hub-channel-id. | Confirm operational parameters via CLI, verify rollapp configuration. | No successful transaction if both EIBC and PFM parameters are attempted together. | Check for error handling and absence of transaction completion. |
