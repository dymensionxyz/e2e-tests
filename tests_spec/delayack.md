### Test Handling Table

| Scenario | Pre-condition | Pre-condition check | Expected result | Expected result check | Covered By |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------|
| IBC transfer from rollapp to hub succeeds when rollapp has NO FINALIZED STATES AT ALL | At least 2 rollapps running, Rollapp A and B. Rollapp B (our rollapp) has no finalized state. Rollapp B has height > Rollapp A height. Rollapp B has a channel-id different from the hub-channel-id. | [ ] | Rollapp tokens successfully transferred to hub despite no finalized states. | [ ] | TODO |
| Rollapp token transfer should only be received on the hub upon rollapp finalized state | At least 2 rollapps running, Rollapp A and B. Rollapp B (our rollapp) is at finalized height < Rollapp A finalized height. Rollapp B has a channel-id different from the hub-channel-id. | [ ] | Rollapp tokens received on hub only after Rollapp B reaches finalized state. | [ ] | TODO |
| Rollapp token Demand order is created upon memo submission and fulfilled | User interacts with UI; At least 2 rollapps running, Rollapp A and B. Rollapp B is at finalized height < Rollapp A finalized height. Rollapp B has a channel-id different from the hub-channel-id. | [ ] | Demand order for Rollapp tokens created and fulfilled upon memo submission. | [ ] | TODO |
| EIBC Timeout from hub to rollapp | User interaction via CLI; At least 2 rollapps running, Rollapp A and B. Rollapp B (our rollapp) is at finalized height < Rollapp A finalized height. Rollapp B has a channel-id different from the hub-channel-id. | [ ] | Timeout triggered for EIBC transaction from hub to rollapp due to non-finalization. | Verify timeout execution and rollback of tokens or state as configured. | TODO |
| EIBC + PFM | User interaction via CLI; At least 2 rollapps running, Rollapp A and B. Rollapp B (our rollapp) is at finalized height < Rollapp A finalized height. Rollapp B has a channel-id different from the hub-channel-id. | [ ] | No successful transaction if both EIBC and PFM parameters are attempted together. | [ ] | TODO |
