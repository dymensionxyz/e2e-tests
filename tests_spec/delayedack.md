# Test Handling Table

## ROLLAPP <-> HUB transfers

| No | Scenario | Pre-condition | Pre-condition check | Steps | Expected result | Expected result check | Covered By |
|----|----------|---------------|---------------------|-------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------|
| 1  | IBC transfer from rollapp to hub succeeds when rollapp has NO FINALIZED STATES AT ALL | At least 2 rollapps running, Rollapp A and B. Rollapp B (our rollapp) has no finalized state. Rollapp B has height > Rollapp A height. Rollapp B has a channel-id different from the hub-channel-id and **no finalized state**| ✅ || RollappPacket successfully created on the hub with pending status (can be checked by `dymd q delayedack packets-by-status pending`) | ✅ | [TestDelayedAck_NoFinalizedStates_EVM](../tests/ibc_grace_period_test.go#L577) [TestDelayedAck_NoFinalizedStates_Wasm](../tests/ibc_grace_period_test.go#L832)|
| 2  | Rollapp token transfer should only be received on the hub upon rollapp finalized state (assume no eIBC packet, i.e no memo) | At least 2 rollapps running, Rollapp A and B. Rollapp B (our rollapp) is at finalized height < Rollapp A finalized height. Rollapp B has a channel-id different from the hub-channel-id. | ✅ || Rollapp tokens received on hub only after Rollapp B reaches finalized state. | ✅ | [TestIBCGracePeriodCompliance_EVM](../tests/ibc_grace_period_test.go#L24) [TestIBCGracePeriodCompliance_Wasm](../tests/ibc_grace_period_test.go#L301)|
| 3  | DYM token transfer from hub to rollapp while relayer is down | - At least 2 rollapps running, Rollapp A and B - Rollapp B (our rollapp) is at finalized height < Rollapp A finalized height - Rollapp B (our rollapp) has a channel-id different than the hub-channel-id (i.e not both are channel-0)| ✅ | - Validate relayer is down - Send rollapp tokens from rollapp to hub - Restart the relayer | Transfer should be picked up and recieved in the rollapp | ✅ | [TestDelayedAck_RelayerDown_EVM](../tests/ibc_grace_period_test.go#L1087) [TestDelayedAck_RelayerDown_Wasm](../tests/ibc_grace_period_test.go#L1357)|
