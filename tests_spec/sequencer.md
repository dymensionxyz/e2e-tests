| 1  | Sequencer successful  state update writes | <ul> <li> at least 2 rollapps registered, Rollapp A and Rollap B </li> <li>  Sequencer is the proposer of Rollapp A </li> </ul> |  ðŸ›‘ <br> (missing) | State update written is with correct data (i.e height, da height, da layer configured by the rollapp) | ðŸ›‘ <br> (missing) | TODO |
| 2  | Sequencer failure to write to settlement layer is recovered | At least 2 rollapps registered, Rollapp A and Rollap B. Sequencer is the proposer of Rollapp A. | - [ ] Check rollapp registration and sequencer roles. <br> - [ ] Take down the settlement layer. <br> - [ ] Monitor rollapp health status. | While rollapp is unhealthy: <br> - Block production stops. <br> - Sending transactions fails. <br> After recovery: <br> - Block production resumes. <br> - Transactions pass. <br> - State updates are written to the settlement layer. | - [ ] Verify block production and transaction status during downtime and after recovery. <br> - [ ] Confirm state update in settlement layer post-recovery. | TODO |
| 3  | Sequencer failure to write to Celestia DA layer is recovered | At least 2 rollapps registered, Rollapp A and Rollap B. Sequencer is the proposer of Rollapp A. | - [ ] Ensure Celestia DA layer is accessible. <br> - [ ] Take down the DA layer. <br> - [ ] Keep the rollapp running. <br> - [ ] Monitor rollapp health status. | While rollapp is unhealthy: <br> - Block production stops. <br> - Sending transactions fails. <br> After recovery: <br> - Block production resumes. <br> - Transactions pass. <br> - State updates are written to the Celestia DA layer. | - [ ] Check for block production cessation and transaction failures when DA layer is down. <br> - [ ] Confirm block production, transactions, and state updates post-recovery. | TODO |
